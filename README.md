# GameDevOctober
GameDevOctober is the first of a series of projects for the GameDev Interest Group at PantherHackers.
For this project, we are taking the base template given by the Top Down example from Unreal Engine, and working on adding our own interactive flavor to it.

# Using GameDevOctober
I have never hosted an Unreal project on GitHub before, and am sure the repo will begin in a buggy mess, don't let that dishearten you! You can always ask for help on Slack.
Reading online, first make a C++ project within Unreal, calling it GameDevOctober. Be sure to close out after creation. 
Navagating to the folder above the project's folder, enter `git clone` followed by the GitHub clone url. This _should_ copy the contents of the GitHub project into your Unreal project. You may need to authorize overwriting files.
From there, it should behave like any other git project.
